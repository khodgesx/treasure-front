# Trashure

Trashure is an app where people can come to give or take "trash." Rather than throw perfectly good items in the trash, offer them up to your fellow person first. 

According to the EPA, the total generation of municipal solid waste (MSW) in 2018 was 292.4 million tons (U.S. short tons, unless specified) or 4.9 pounds per person per day. 

Why add more trash? Why spend unnecessary money? Rather, let your trash become someone else's treasure or find your next trash treasure or trashure!

## Tech Stack: 
### Front-End: React.js
### [Back-End ReadMe](link to backend readme): Django, Python, PostgreSQL 
### [Back-End Deployment](https://treasure-trash-api.herokuapp.com/)

## MVP:
- Django Back-End: Serve a JSON API with all CRUD operations available across your model. The Django API must be deployed online via Heroku and have at least one model.
- React Front-End: Serve a React front-end that consumes your Django API. You should be able to perform all CRUD operations through the React app and have them execute in and persist in the Django database. THe React front-end must be deployed online, separately from your API, via Heroku.
- Two git repositories hosted on Github, with a link to the releveant live sites, and frequent commits dating back to the beginning of the project. 

## Stretch Goals:
- Image upload 
- React Router
- CSS framework - React Bootstrap

## Future Goals:
- User login functionality
- Connect user to item model - user can edit/delete item only if user created it
- Location API - Google Maps - to find free things near you
